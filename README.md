## 🚀 1. Project Title
**Enterprise Sales Intelligence & Global Product Performance Analytics**

## 🎯 2. Business Problem Statement
Organizations operating across multiple product categories and geographical regions often struggle with fragmented data, making it difficult to identify underperforming assets or capitalize on high-growth trends. 

This analysis addresses the need for high-level executive visibility and granular operational detail for **Sales Directors and Senior Financial Analysts** to optimize supply chains and marketing spend.

## 🥅 3. Objective of the Analysis
* 📈 **Performance Tracking:** Evaluate sales and profit performance against historical trends.
* 🔍 **Market Identification:** Identify high-value product categories and geographic hotspots.
* ⚖️ **Optimization:** Balance inventory strategies by analyzing the relationship between volume and net profitability.

## 📂 4. Dataset Overview
* **Source:** Multi-relational ERP export (Orders, Products, Companies, Geography, Categories).
* **Period:** January 2021 – April 2025.
* **Scope:** 50+ Unique SKUs, 5 Product Categories, 10 Major US Market Hubs.

## 💎 5. Key KPIs
* **Total Sales** – Gross revenue generated from transactions.
* **Total Profit** – Net earnings after Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
* **Total Orders** – Transactional volume indicating market demand.
* **Total Quantity** – Physical units moved for logistics planning.

## 🛠️ 6. Technical Approach
* ⚙️ **Data ETL:** Normalized disparate CSVs in Power Query and built a `dimDate` table for **Fiscal Year** reporting.
* 🏗️ **Modeling:** Developed a **Star Schema** with 1:N relationships for optimized filtering.
* 🧪 **DAX:** Engineered time-intelligence measures (YTD, YoY) and dynamic ranking.
* 🎛️ **Parameters:** Integrated selection logic to toggle views between **Sales, Orders, and Returns**.

## 💡 7. Key Findings & Insights
* **Electronics Dominance:** Cameras and Projectors are the primary revenue drivers.
* **Mature Markets:** New York and Seattle show the highest sales density and stability.
* **Margin Insight:** Certain "Tools" show higher margins despite lower unit volume.
* **Growth Trend:** Significant performance spikes identified in the 2023–2024 period.
